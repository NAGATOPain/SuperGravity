# SuperGravity
This game is my first LibGDX game which I developed myself. 
The plot of this game is trying to not make the character falls, or smacks to the pipe. The score of this game is counted by time
that the character survives. 
Here is a tutorial about how to use my code: 
- resource folder: this is a folder contains any audios, textures or background music that be used in this game
- core folder: this is a folder contains all of important code : 
+ MainGame.java: main class of this game
+ GameConstants.java: a class has all of constant (like witdh of game's world in desktop) which this game uses.
+ GameObject folder: contains all of game object activities, etc; like character, pipes, background,...
+ GameScene folder: contains all scene of this game, include opening, playing and ending.
+ GameComponent folder: contains all things that need to make this game more better.
